spamscanner
===========

A tool to scan and remove spam mails in your
mailboxes, using Bogofilter [1].

* PREREQUISITES

Before you can start, please make sure that
you have:

  - Your mail synced locally with mbsync or
  offlineimap,...
  - Bogofilter installed and trained (if you
  don't have it yet, see the next section).
  - A mail client like Mutt, mu4e,...
  
* BOGOFILTER TRAINING WITH MUTT

If you're using Mutt, you can use the following
keybindings to train Bogofilter:

  # Move mail back to inbox and mark as not spam
  macro index,pager . "<enter-command>unset wait_key\n<tag-prefix><pipe-entry>bogofilter -Mn\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n<save-message>=<enter>"

  # Mark as not spam and do nothing else
  macro index n "<enter-command>unset wait_key\n<tag-prefix><pipe-entry>bogofilter -Mn\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n"
  macro pager n "<enter-command>unset wait_key\n<pipe-entry>bogofilter -Mn\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n"

  # Mark as spam and delete
  macro index x "<enter-command>unset wait_key\n<tag-prefix><pipe-entry>bogofilter -MNs\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n<tag-prefix><save-message>=../spam<enter>"
  macro pager x "<enter-command>unset wait_key\n<pipe-entry>bogofilter -MNs\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n<save-message>=../spam</enter>"

* FILTERING SPAM WITH BOGOFILTER

Let's assume you have all your mails stored
in ~/mail directory. Each of the sub folder
is a mailbox, following the Maildir format:

.
├── inbox
│   ├── cur
│   ├── new
│   └── tmp
├── spam
│   ├── cur
│   ├── new
│   └── tmp
└── trash
    ├── cur
    ├── new
    └── tmp

The [inbox] is where you got all of your mail
stored. And [spam] is where you want to store
all of the junk mail.

If you do not use the same scheme as above, you
will need to change the following config:

  SRC=$HOME/mail/inbox
  DST=$HOME/mail/spam/new
  
The $DST variable is the target directory where
you will move all of the junk mail to, it's the
[new] folder because we want to see which email
is newly moved in. And $SRC is where your inbox
stay.

Run the scan script:

  ./spamscanner
  
The spamscanner will scan every mail in the inbox
and pipe that email to Bogofilter, if it's a spam
mail, Bogofilter will return something in the form
of "X-Bogosity: Spam", the script will then check
this header and move spam mails into [spam] mailbox.

During the check, the script will count for the spam
mail and eventually trigger a notification message
telling you how many mail has been moved to spam.

You can set a cronjob to run [spamscanner] periodically
or integrate it to your mail fetcher, for example, with
offlineimap:

  postsynchook = /your/path/to/spamscanner
